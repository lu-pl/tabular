TabulaR - Functionality for DataFrame to RDF conversions.

Note that although TabulaR was designed primarily for table to RDF conversions, the `TemplateConverter` class is general enough to allow basically any target format.
See e.g. the `TemplateXMLConverter` class. [todo]

## Requirements

* python >= 3.10

## Usage
TabulaR provides two main approaches for table conversions, a template-based approach using the [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating engine and a pure Python/callable-based approach.

### Template converters

### Python/callable converters
